				<h2>Morals</h2>
				<p id="morals">Taking advantage of the innocent is a vile act. We believe animals should live a fair and humane life
					no matter the cost. Although human interference like euthanization, castration, and sterilization may be unappealing
					to most, it is inevitable. Animals at the brink of extinction should be helped in order to renew their population in
					the wild. However, human interventions should not be abused. Animals should not be euthanized by the millions especially if they don’t need to be put out of their misery. Help prevent this by adopting, not buying to minimize these methods.</p>

				<h2>Goals</h2>
				<p id="goals">Our ambitious goal is to create a planet where we can prevent animal cruelty as much as possible. We also wish to bring justice to abused and tortured animals. However, the only way to achieve this goal is to work together and create a humane world for animals. We challenge you to make a difference however small or big. Our furry friends will appreciate it!<p>

          <h2>Solutions</h2>
          <p id="solutions">There are many ways to help animals. If you see any animal cruelty acts being commited, report it. There are many websites that include petitions where you can sign them. They also include updates and news about major animal cruelty cases. Read these! You’ll know that you’re making a difference.<br>Volunteer in animal shelters! Donate to organizations that you trust! A more long-term solution is encouraging the creation of laws where animal cruelty can become a more serious crime. Lastly, you can become part of our collective movement by spreading the word. Share this on social media! The internet is a powerful tool!</br></p>
